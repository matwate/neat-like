# NEAT-Like stuff from pezza's work videos implemented in go.

Note: **this readme is more like a personal to do list than a project readme**

## Features

1. [x] Use of DAG to represent the neural network
2. [ ] Use of NEAT-like algorithm to evolve the network

### Tasks

1. [x] Implement the DAG
2. [x] Implement the evolving algorithm
3. [ ] Implement the genetic algorithm to select agents according to their fitness
